## O mnie
Hi, my name is Kamil Stefański-Polek. I have graduated as engineer from UR Kraków, specializing in transport and logistics. 
I am at the beggining of my software tester journey. 
For now I am gaining:
* practical abilities on uTest platform (for over a two years now),

On this site I would like to share with you everything I have achieved so far.
I am constantly developing, so everything you see here is also constantly updated.
